# Portfolio

In this portfolio, I share a selection of projects that illustrate my skills in problem-solving and impact generation through *Data Analysis*, *Process Automation*, and more. Each project is a testament to my ability to manipulate, analyze, and translate data into useful and actionable insights.

I appreciate your interest and invite you to explore further. Thanks for visiting!

This is due to the fact that there have been several complaints from national and international guests. Therefore, the goal is to identify areas for improvement, strengthen positive aspects, and engage with hosts to propose solutions to improve the guest experience.
